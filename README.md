# DiscordMotivate
Discord bot code that has some motivational quotes for when you need them or want to hear some.

DiscordMotivate was written in Python. I have added a lot of commands and different types of quotes and features.

Commands:

- ?motivateme - Get general motivational quote.
- ?sport - Get a motivational quote related to sports.
- ?actual - Get a quote from an actual person.
- ?competitive - Get a competitive quote.
- ?random - Get a random quote from any of the above categories.
- ?ping - Ping user and check if bot is working.
- ?help - Display help message.
- ?end - Make bot go offline. Only can be used by owner or anyone who is set to be allowed.

Coming soon...

- ?whoami - Pings you and shows your username and pfp in a message.
- ?ignore - Ignore all commands, so basically temporarily stopping bot usage.
- ?listen - Start accepting commands again.
- ?switchprefix [what prefix to use] - Switch prefix from default to one of these options: "?", ".", "!", "$". Default is "?".
  
How do I let the code know I am the owner for the ?end command authorisation?

- The owner authorisation is optional and I only put it there because I was bored but here's how you use it.

1. Find your Discord user ID.
2. Go to the code and look at the top for 'YOUR_DISCORD_USER_ID'.
3. Replace this with your user ID.
4. Done!

Also remember to change 'YOUR_BOT_TOKEN' with your actual bot token.
Make sure all message intents are set to ON in the Discord Developer Portal.
